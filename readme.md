## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using Composer:

```

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

```shell
composer require --dev phpzendo/php-comparison
```

## Usage

### Verify the given value is empty.

```php
<?php

use PhpZendo\Comparison\Compare;

$comparator = Compare::getInstance();
$comparator->empty(null);
```

### Verify the given value is null.

```php
<?php

use PhpZendo\Comparison\Compare;

$comparator = Compare::getInstance();
$comparator->isNull(null);
```

### Verify the given value is set.

```php
<?php

use PhpZendo\Comparison\Compare;

$comparator = Compare::getInstance();
$comparator->isset(null);
```

## Compare two values.

```php
<?php

use PhpZendo\Comparison\Compare;

$comparator = Compare::getInstance();

$comparator->gt($expected = 2, $actual = 1);// Check $expected great than $actual.
$comparator->gte($expected = 1, $actual = 1);// Check $expected great than or equal $actual.
$comparator->lt($expected = 1, $actual = 2);// Check $expected less than $actual.
$comparator->lte($expected = 2, $actual = 2);// Check $expected less than or equal $actual.
```
